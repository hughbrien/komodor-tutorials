# Komodor Failure Scenarios

This repository is your go-to repository to run scenarios on your clusters. It allows you simulate a day-to-day real life scenario besides edge cases. After running these scenarios, you will be able to see how Komodor can help you to easily identify and remediate these scenarios.


## How to Use?
Pick a scenario from the list below, apply it to your cluster. Check in Komodor the right resources (usually a service).


## Before Starting

Make sure you got the [Komodor agent running](https://docs.komodor.com/Learn/Install-Komodor-Agent.html) and configured on your clusters.
Configure alerts to get alert in each failure.
